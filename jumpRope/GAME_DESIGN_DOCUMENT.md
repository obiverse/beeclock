## Core Mechanics

### The Double Dutch Foundation
Two virtual rope turners stand at opposite ends, turning ropes in synchronized or alternating patterns. The player controls a jumper in the center.

### Control Schemes

#### 2D Mode
- **Tap** = Jump
- **Hold** = High Jump (for double-unders)
- **Swipe Left/Right** = Dodge/Shuffle
- **Double Tap** = Spin Jump (style points)

#### 3D Mode
- **Tap** = Jump
- **Swipe Up** = High Jump
- **Swipe Down** = Duck (for high ropes)
- **Tilt** = Lateral movement
- **Two-finger tap** = Trick moves

### Rhythm System
- Ropes turn at beats-per-minute (BPM) synced to music
- Visual and audio cues signal optimal jump timing
- "Perfect", "Good", "Early", "Late" feedback
- Combo multipliers for consecutive perfect jumps

---

## Game Modes
